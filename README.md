# pokedex
This is my very first actual project. Before, I always just tried things out one at a time, this is supposed to be a complete small project.

I am using the pokemon API to build a pokedex: A simple website that shows you the name and picture of a pokemon after you select its id.

I was mostly focusing on the design aspect in this project, which is why its functionality is so simple.
